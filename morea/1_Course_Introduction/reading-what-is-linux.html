  <h1 id="what-is-gnulinux">What is GNU/Linux?</h1>

<h2 id="the-operating-system">The operating system</h2>

<p>GNU/Linux is a UNIX-like operating system (OS) composed of GNU packages and coreutils, and the Linux kernel. Packages are just bundles of data and software that make up programs, along with additional information about the program/software. UNIX will be explained in detail in the next module, so don’t worry if you don’t know what it is.</p>

<h2 id="gnu">GNU</h2>

<p>GNU is a large, collaborative project containing a collection of free and open source software (FOSS). GNU is an acronym standing for <em>“GNU’s Not Unix!”</em>, so while it follows the same rules of a Unix OS, it is different because it’s FOSS and written without Unix code. The GNU Project is led by Richard Stallman of the Free Software Foundation, and it contains the core utilities and basic tools that make up the GNU/Linux OS. GNU is made up entirely of free software, and by free, we don’t just mean free as in free soda, but free as in freedom. FOSS gives you the freedom to actually own your software, and use it for any purpose, as well as change it to your liking. It would techincally be more accurate to call the OS GNU, as opposed to Linux, because it has all of the software in the OS, excluding the kernel.</p>

<h2 id="linux">Linux</h2>

<p>Linux is the kernel of the operating system. The kernel is the central core of the OS that handles Input/Output requests from software. So basically, it links the software and hardware (specifically, the central processing unit, or CPU) which allows your computer to do things like carry out commands or run programs. You can think of the kernel like the brain of a human. Nearly every organ is necessary for survival and classifying us as humans, but the brain is the most important part that tells each organ what to do and how to do it.</p>

<h2 id="the-naming-controversy">The naming controversy</h2>

<p>Members of the FOSS community have argued for years whether to call the OS “GNU/Linux” or just “Linux”. There are strong arguments for both sides of the debate, and while “GNU/Linux” is actually the correct name of the OS, in the rest of the modules, we will just refer to the OS as “Linux”. This is mainly because we’re just using Linux as shorthand for GNU/Linux, but know that while we’re referring to it as just “Linux”, the actual name of the OS is “GNU/Linux”.</p>

<h2 id="why-use-it">Why use it?</h2>

<p>You should use Linux because it’s the greatest OS of all time. Seriously. Go home, delete Windows/OS X, and install Linux (only if you know how to though).</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Privacy</strong>: Linux boasts a superiority in privacy. It doesn’t phone home to any companies or share your information with anyone (unless you enable it on certain distributions), unlike Windows and OS X which give your information and even the files on your machine to Microsoft and Apple respectively.</li>
  <li><strong>Free</strong>: Linux is both free in terms of money and freedom. You can do anything you want with it, as it is your OS. You’re not just paying for a license to use a company’s OS which you have limited access to.</li>
  <li><strong>Open and shared</strong>: The source code for Linux distributions is easily accesible and shared with the community, so everyone can audit it and make sure there isn’t any malware that will infect your machine. There aren’t any updates hiding anything, which is a huge problem with other popular OSes.</li>
  <li><strong>More control</strong>: Using Linux gives you more direct access to your computer, so you can do more cool things with it! You’ll know what you’re doing to your computer with each command and what’s happening. Also, because of this and the fact that every part of the OS is isolated, there are no viruses!</li>
  <li><strong>Distributions</strong>: There is an abundance of different distributions that you can download, install, and use.</li>
</ul>
