<p>This course focuses on the instruction and usage of the GNU/Linux operating system. Some of the topics we cover are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>GNU/Linux</strong> For this course, we will teach students the intricacies of the operating system, GNU/Linux. Students will learn how to use it efficiently through the command-line interface (CLI). We will wean students off of their dependancy on graphical user interfaces and the mouse with the use of window managers and the CLI.</li>
  <li><strong>Bash</strong> The shell and command line we will be using is Bash, the Bourne-again shell. Students will use Bash in the terminal to exert greater influence over their machines.</li>
  <li><strong>Vim</strong> All coding in this course will be done using the text editor Vim. Vim exclusively operates using keyboard bindings and shortcuts to maximize efficiency, as its users no longer have to waste time reaching over to use their slow, clunky mouse.</li>
  <li><strong>Python</strong> The main programming language we will be teaching in this course is Python, which is a versatile, powerful, and easy-to-learn language.</li>
  <li><strong>Networking</strong> After covering the fundamentals of shell scripting and programming, students will learn about networking concepts and how devices communicate over the internet. A great usage of Linux is not only its superiority in its development environment, but also in networking application.</li>
  <li><strong>Git/GitHub</strong> Students will learn to use Git version control and collaborative programming and design. They’ll also be pushing their code up to the code-sharing site GitHub, so they can work on their projects from any device with an internet connection.</li>
  <li><strong>Free and open-source software</strong> In this class, students are using free and open source software (FOSS). One of the main benefits of using Linux is its emphasis on freedom and privacy. We want to foster an appreciation for and have students understand the importance of FOSS.</li>
</ul>
