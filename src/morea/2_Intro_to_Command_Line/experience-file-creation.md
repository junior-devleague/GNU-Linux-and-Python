# File Creation

## CLI Text Editor

In this class, we want to minimize the usage of graphical user interfaces (GUIs), so we'll be using CLI text editors. The main text editor we'll be using in this class is Vim, but until we reach the Vim module, we'll be using Nano, a really simple and easy-to-use CLI editor. To use Nano, type in the `nano` command, or `nano [file]` to edit a file. The commands for Nano are located at the bottom of the terminal emulator, but the main ones you need to know are `Ctrl + O` to save, and `Ctrl + X` to save and exit. When doing so, make sure to pay attention to the bottom for the filename and other prompts.

## Instructions

All of the following must be done exclusively in your terminal with Bash. **Do not use a file manager.**

If you don’t remember the commands you need to use or how to use them, look back on the “[Basic Bash](https://junior-devleague.github.io/JDLA-GNU-Linux-and-Python/morea/2_Intro_to_Command_Line/reading-basic-bash.html)” reading or check the manual with the `man` command.

1. In your Desktop, create a directory named after yourself (include first and last name).
2. Within that folder, make two directories for different projects named _`BashExercises`_ and _`Python_Work`_, and two files named _`named_with_underscores`_ and _`thisIsCamelCase`_.
3. In each directory, create an _`index.html`_ file, a _`css`_ directory, and an _`images`_ directory.
4. Create a _`styles.css`_ file in one of the `css` directories, and **copy** it into the other.
5. Use `nano` to edit the `named_with_underscores` file to say “_The statement below is true._”
6. Use `nano` to edit the `thisIsCamelCase` file to say “_The statement above is false._”
7. Concatenate both of the above ASCII text files and print them into the terminal together using one command.
8. Move `named_with_underscores` into the `Python_Work` directory.
9. Move `thisIsCamelCase` into the `BashExercises` directory.

When you’ve finished, let one of the instructors know and we will look at your files and history.
