# What is a Shell?

A _shell_ is the program that passes keyboard commands to the _operating system_ (such as Windows, OS X, GNU/Linux, BSD) to carry out.

If you’ve heard of “the terminal” before, you probably just know it as the black box where hackers rapidly type things into. This is somewhat correct. The **terminal emulator** is the window that allows us to use the **command-line interface (CLI)**, which is _where_ we directly interact with the shell. It basically allows us to completely control the computer as well as execute commands. If you want absolute authority over your system, you would use the CLI for a fast and efficient experience without having to use your slow and clunky mouse. You also have the added bonus of feeling like an elite hacker while using it!

Because the command line gives you complete control over your machine, remember to **use it wisely**. You don't want to break your system, so **NEVER** type in commands if you don't know what they do. If you ever find a command online, and you don't understand every part of it, do some research before using it. Also, **double check what you typed in before pressing Enter!** If you mistype something, that could be devastating, so no matter how much of an awesome typist you think you are, you could've made a mistake that could ruin hours of hard work.

The default shell for UNIX operating systems (like GNU/Linux and Mac OS X) is **Bash**. Bash is the command language you use when entering commands into the terminal.

Here at Academy, regardless of the class you take, you’ll be learning Bash.
